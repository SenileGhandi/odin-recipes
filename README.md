This project is to build a recipe site linking several web pages together as a
practice. I will update this with all relevant skills included upon completion.

Created an index page with links to 3 html pages inside the same directory
Each recipe was it's own html page and each included a picture linked as a 
hyperlink. Each recipe had a title and a brief description
Each page was formatted with ordered lists for the ingredients
and unordered lists for the directions.
